# PnR-Final
The final project for my Programming and Robotics class.  My job was to move my robot from one side of an obstacle course to the other.  Using what I have learned in Mr. Adiletta's Programming and Robotics class I
have programmed my robot to do just that.

#Some Things To Know
Mr. Adiletta has created a parent class, pigo.py, that had the basic code to get us started.  In the pigo.py file Mr. Adiletta will also update it with handy new methods to help us out.  We worked in the student.py file.
The first method that I made was the dance method.  At the very top of my code I have put some instance variables that remain constant throughout all my code.  Some of the variables include my midpoint, the point at which my robots
head is facing forward, and my left and right speed.

#About Some of My Methods
`self.lazy()`
The lazy method that I created is  kind of self explanatory, and slightly stupid.  When I was calibrating my robot I got very tired of having to get up every time and pick up my robot and bring it back.
I thought to myself, "Wow I wish my robot could magically just come bcak to me".  Then I realized that I could.  Basically, I just made a method to move backwards a little bit and added it to my menu.
